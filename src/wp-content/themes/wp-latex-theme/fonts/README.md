# Fonts

`wp-latex-theme` uses Google Fonts. Since there are some GDPR controversies in August 2022, `wp-latex-theme` requires you to self host the fonts.

All required `.css` files are already here. Download the required fonts over at [this site][font-download]. You need `Old Standard TT` and `Titillium Web`. In section 1 select "latin" and "latin-ext". In section 3 select "best support".

Upload all files from the downloaded archive in `wp-latex-theme/fonts`.
